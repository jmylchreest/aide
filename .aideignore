# .aideignore — project-specific patterns for aide findings analysers
#
# Patterns follow gitignore syntax. Built-in defaults already cover common
# directories (node_modules, .git, vendor, etc.) and generated file patterns
# (*.pb.go, *_generated.go, etc.), so this file only needs project-specific
# additions or overrides.
#
# Use ! to negate (un-ignore) a previously matched pattern.

# ── Test files (reduce clone noise from repeated setup/assertion patterns) ──
*_test.go

# ── Test fixture data (embedded secrets, high-complexity samples, etc.) ──
**/testdata/

# ── Grammar testdata should be scanned (exercises language detection) ──
!aide/pkg/grammar/testdata/

# ── Protobuf generated code (already covered by *.pb.go default, but
#    being explicit about the grpcapi output directory) ──
aide/pkg/grpcapi/*.pb.go

# ── Mirrored TypeScript packages (same code in two locations) ──
packages/opencode-plugin/src/
